How the IT Ticketing System Works (Simple Explanation)

This system helps track and manage IT support requests easily. Here’s how it works:

1. Submit a Ticket
Who: Employees with IT issues

How: Fill out a simple form with:

Name, email, department

Priority level (Low → Critical)

Description of the problem

What happens: Ticket gets added to the queue.

2. Track & Manage Tickets
Who: IT team/Admins

How:

View all tickets in one list, sorted by priority (Critical first).

Update status (Open → In Progress → Resolved).

Close tickets when fixed.

Admin Controls:

Password-protected actions (delete/edit tickets).

3. No-Setup Usage
Runs in any browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

No installation needed – just open the HTML file.

Data saved automatically (until browser cache is cleared).
